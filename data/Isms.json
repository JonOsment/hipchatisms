Listen to your clients. In fact, listen to everyone. Everything starts with awareness. Being alert. Being awake. Tuning in to the frequency. It's a perpetual choice to both stay aware and raise your level of awareness. Our future, growth, innovation and success start with the thousands of eyeballs of our team members. That's you.",

	"Description": "If a company does one big thing better than their competition, it becomes fairly easy for their competition to level the playing field: they can just imitate that one thing. But, if a company does thousands of little things better than anyone else, they become nearly impossible to imitate. We call those thousands of little things 'inches.' We'd never be able to foresee all the things that should be noticed or improved. Instead, we drive a culture that motivates our team members to find the inches we need all around us. We are all empowered to find the opportunities to make an impact everywhere; one inch at a time, these inches all add up to greatness.",

Urgency motivates us to ensure we communicate all news fast, both good and bad. We take care of things, especially our clients … NOW!",

This does not mean that every single idea, question, suggestion or recommendation will ultimately be met with a big thumbs-up. It means that we respond to all curiosity with the mindset of YES first. Our bias is to the YES side of life. This is in stark contrast to the too common approach of an automatic NO to any expression of an inquiring mind. Saying NO is easier, but the status quo is not our favorite state. We live in the land of growth, possibilities, ideas, innovation, positive impact and results. The only path to that place is through openness to the unknown. So YES before NO, and NO only if we have done the work and exhausted all the potential of YES first.",

Think about how much a company compromises itself by basing decisions on WHO is in favor or against something instead of WHAT is the best and right decision. The WHAT trumps the WHO in our shop.",

When there' s a decision to be made,there are three possible outcomes: 1. You make the right one– Great! 2. You make the wrong one– Hopefully you learn something valuable from it. 3. You make no decision– You haven' t made the right one, and you haven' t learned a thing.

If we believe in ourselves first, we dramatically increase our odds of success. If we believe it can happen, then it will.",

We have faith that when it comes to some of the details, we'll figure it out along the way. If we wait to cross every 't' and dot every 'i' before proceeding with an idea, concept or improvement, then we wouldn't make much progress at all. It's our belief in each other and ourselves that gives us the confidence to find new solutions to keep us moving forward. Sometimes a game-changing project will be held up because of a small detail that doesn't matter. Should we solve for the exception and delay the launch of a project that could otherwise make a huge impact? No! Instead, we take the roast out of the oven and figure out the exception as we go. That's how we roll. We know that building something new or creating something special is messy, and that greatness doesn't always come in nice, tidy packages. This is an advantage, not a hindrance. As long as we continue to love the idea and trust the process, then we truly believe we'll figure it out.",

Simplifying things in this fast-moving, complicated world isn't just good – it's GREAT. Simple design. Simple process. Simple communication. When we communicate with others, we cannot assume they know exactly what we know. You are you, and they are them. We must start at chapter one, not chapter five. Simplicity doesn't just clarify; it creates wealth in the process. Because if there is anything in this world that everyone can agree upon (outside of the 'intellects,' of course), it's that simplicity makes things better for everybody. That's why simple is something we strive for in everything we do. All day. Every day. It's as simple as that.",
